Very Basic Android Program 1

In this assignment, you are to write an application that allows user to create a list of information
about different photos. Information includes “name” tag for the photo, the date it was taken, and
the name of its photographer. The information should be stored in a file or files on the device.

The app should work as follows:
❏ the starting screen should have 3 buttons: enter info, view, and exit.

❏ pressing “enter info” should take the user to a new screen where they can enter a series
of information describing a photo: name for the photo, the year it was taken, and the
name of its photographer. selection of year should be from a drop down list of different
years. the user may return to the starting screen through a “done” button and the
information they entered will be stored.

❏ the “view” button displays all information about the photos stored in the application in a
scrollable list. information for each photo can be shown as one string.

❏ the “exit” button terminates the application, but makes sure that the list of photos will
be stored first.
